ProjectQuad
===========

A clone of Minecraft.  For whatever reason I decided I wanted to make a simple game with minimal usage of shaders.  My reasoning: I had a talk with Texas A&amp;M's Dr. Keiser a few months ago and he mentioned that opengl built in functions if done properly could still be as effective.  It's time to put that to the test.  In the future after my testing however, I may decide to make the game run on shaders.
